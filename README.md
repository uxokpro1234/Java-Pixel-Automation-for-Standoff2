# Java-Pixel-Automation-for-Standoff2
This repository contains a **legacy experiment** using Java's `Robot` class to automate UI interactions based on pixel colors.
It was originally designed for Standoff 2 automation but has been intentionally disabled due to changes in the game's UI (particles) and is provided solely for educational purposes.


**Important:**  
- Originally inspired by Standoff 2’s UI for educational purposes only.  
- The code is **non-functional** due to dynamic visual effects (particles, animations).  
- This project is provided **solely for learning and historical reference**.

## Notes
- Do **not** attempt to use this in live applications or games.  
- Coordinates, colors, and automation logic are specific to the original experiment and may **cause unintended behavior**.
